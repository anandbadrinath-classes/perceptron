# Perceptron

## Running
The functions to implement for the exercises are located in perceptron_src/Perceptron_td.py. Once you are satisfied with your implementation, you can run the program using:

```
./run.sh perceptron
```

Once your code passes all of the tests for an exercise you may move on to the next one by uncommenting the function call for that exercise in main.py.

Make sure you do the exercises in order as the the later ones depend on the ones before.
