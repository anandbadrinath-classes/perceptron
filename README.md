# Perceptron

## Prerequisites
[Python3.5](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.4/python-3.5.4.exe)

## Installing

### Pip
If you do not have pip, you can install it by running

```
python3 get-pip.py
```

### Python requirements
Once pip is installed you can download the requirements for this project with

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
The functions to implement for the exercises are located in perceptron_src/Perceptron_td.py. Once you are satisfied with your implementation, you can run the program using:

```
python3 main.py
```

Once your code passes all of the tests for an exercise you may move on to the next one by uncommenting the function call for that exercise in main.py.

Make sure you do the exercises in order as the the later ones depend on the ones before.
